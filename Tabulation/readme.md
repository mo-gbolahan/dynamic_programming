##Using Tabulation


1. First, create a table using the inputs of the problem (visualize the problem as a table).
2. Initialize the table with default value.
3. Seed the trivial answer into the table. Basically, assign a value to the base case of the table.
4. Use an iterative strategy instaed of recussive strategy. Iterate the through the table.
5. Fill further positions based on the current position.
